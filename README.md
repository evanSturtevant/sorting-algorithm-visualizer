# sorting-algorithm-visualizer
Worked with a partner to analyze various sorting algorithms for runtime complexity

This was a project for the class Algorithms and Analysis. The objective of the project was to compare two O(n^2) sorting algorithms with two O(lg(n)) sorting algorithms.
This project shows an understanding of algorithm runtime complexity, as well as use of from-scratch graphcial displays.
